# IRAH

IRAH is an LLM-powered platform for content aggregation, information search/synthesis, and content generation that assists professionals in the Wealth & Asset Management industry perform their jobs more efficiently.

IRAH includes a user interface (UI), an application programming interface (API), and a file-processing module for processing documents. It uses Python for backend operations and Angular for frontend operations.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main folders: `api`, `ui`, and `file-processing`,

### API

The `api` folder contains all the backend code for the application. This includes the communication with the LLMs & other data systems. It includes several utility scripts for data processing, fetching, and management. The main entry point of the application is `run.py`.

## UI

The `ui` folder contains the frontend code for the application. It includes all the Angular components, services, models, and styles. It also includes the `angular.json` configuration file, `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for managing npm packages, and `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.

### File-Processing

The `file-processing` folder includes scripts for processing and managing files & documents. It includes preprocessing scripts, summary templates, embedding scripts, and more. The file-processing module is designed to run as a function using Azure Functions. This allows for automated processing of documents as their are loaded to a file store.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:ey-org/irah.git
```
2. Install Python packages
```sh
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
cd ../ui
npm install
```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally:

1. Start the API server
```sh
cd api
python run.py --debug
```

2. Start the Angular server
```sh
cd ../ui
ng serve
```

The API server will start on localhost:5000 and the Angular server will start on localhost:4200.

Note: In order to successfully connect to the various data sources & API endpoints required by IRAH, you will need to include a devConfig.yml file in your project directory. This file contains the API keys and other secrets for connecting to these services. Please reach out to Matt O'Neill (matt.oneill@ey.com) for access.
